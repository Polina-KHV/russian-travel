# **RUSSIAN-TRAVEL**
## Student project for [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/)

This page contains interesting and usefull information about travelling in Russia. Here you can read about the places with the most beautiful nature in our country. And you can also find the links for some usefull travel sources.  
This student project is made with HTML and CSS codes using BEM methodology. Here i used flex and grid to make structures with photos and cards. I also tried to make this page adaptive for different screen types.

Hope i will make it truely adaptive for more different screen sizes. Maybe some day...
